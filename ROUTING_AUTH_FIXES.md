# Routing and Authentication Fixes

## Date: October 27, 2025

## 🐛 Issues Fixed

### 1. **Navigation Routes Mismatch**
**Problem:** Navigation links in sidebar were pointing to absolute paths (`/medicines`, `/equipment`) but routes were nested under `/dashboard` (`/dashboard/medicines`, `/dashboard/equipment`), causing blank pages.

**Solution:**
- Updated all navigation links in `Layout.tsx` to use full paths:
  - `/medicines` → `/dashboard/medicines`
  - `/equipment` → `/dashboard/equipment`
  - `/suppliers` → `/dashboard/suppliers`
  - `/orders` → `/dashboard/orders`
  - `/maintenance` → `/dashboard/maintenance`
  - `/` → `/dashboard` (for dashboard home)

**Files Modified:** `/frontend/src/components/Layout.tsx`

---

### 2. **Authentication Logic Flaw**
**Problem:** Authenticated users could still access the login page, creating a poor user experience.

**Solution:**
- Created `PublicRoute` component that redirects authenticated users to dashboard
- Wrapped login route with `PublicRoute` component
- Now authenticated users are automatically redirected to `/dashboard` when trying to access `/login`

**Files Modified:** `/frontend/src/App.tsx`

**Implementation:**
```tsx
function PublicRoute({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  const { isAuthenticated } = useAuth();
  return !isAuthenticated ? <>{children}</> : <Navigate to="/dashboard" />;
}
```

### 3. **Type Mismatch in Orders Form**
**Problem:** Supplier field in orders form had type mismatch (storing number but typed as Supplier object).

**Solution:**
- Added `selectedSupplierId` state variable
- Updated form to use separate ID state
- Properly resolve supplier object when submitting

**Files Modified:** `/frontend/src/pages/OrdersPage.tsx`

---

### 4. **Type Mismatch in Maintenance Form**
**Problem:** Equipment field in maintenance form had similar type mismatch issue.

**Solution:**
- Added `selectedEquipmentId` state variable
- Updated form to use separate ID state
- Properly resolve equipment object when submitting

**Files Modified:** `/frontend/src/pages/MaintenancePage.tsx`

---

### 5. **Missing Empty States**
**Problem:** Orders and Maintenance pages lacked empty state messages.

**Solution:**
- Added empty state messages to both tables:
  - Orders: "No orders found. Click 'Add Order' to get started."
  - Maintenance: "No maintenance records found. Click 'Add Maintenance Record' to get started."

**Files Modified:** 
- `/frontend/src/pages/OrdersPage.tsx`
- `/frontend/src/pages/MaintenancePage.tsx`

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Route Structure
```
/                          → Landing Page (public)
/login                     → Login Page (public, redirects if authenticated)
/dashboard                 → Dashboard (protected)
/dashboard/medicines       → Medicines Page (protected)
/dashboard/equipment       → Equipment Page (protected)
/dashboard/suppliers       → Suppliers Page (protected)
/dashboard/orders          → Orders Page (protected)
/dashboard/maintenance     → Maintenance Page (protected)
```

### Protection Pattern
```tsx
// Protected routes - require authentication
<ProtectedRoute>
  <Layout>
    <Outlet /> {/* Nested routes render here */}
  </Layout>
</ProtectedRoute>

// Public routes - redirect if authenticated
<PublicRoute>
  <LoginPage />
</PublicRoute>
```

## 🎯 Testing Instructions

### Test Navigation
1. Login with admin credentials
2. Click each menu item in sidebar
3. Verify each page loads correctly
4. Check URL matches expected pattern

### Test Authentication
1. **When Not Logged In:**
   - Try to access `/dashboard` → should redirect to `/login`
   - Try to access `/dashboard/medicines` → should redirect to `/login`

2. **When Logged In:**
   - Try to access `/login` → should redirect to `/dashboard`
   - Access any dashboard route → should load normally
   - Logout → should redirect to `/login`

### Test Forms
1. **Medicines:** Create/edit with supplier selection
2. **Equipment:** Create/edit with supplier selection
3. **Orders:** Create/edit with supplier selection
4. **Maintenance:** Create/edit with equipment selection

### Test Empty States
1. Clear all orders (if any) → see empty state
2. Clear all maintenance records (if any) → see empty state
3. Verify helpful messages display
