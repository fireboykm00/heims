## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Cannot Delete Yourself**
   - The current admin cannot delete their own account
   - Prevents accidental system lockout
   - Use another admin account if needed

   - New password is immediately hashed and active
   - Old password cannot be recovered

3. **Default Users**
   - System comes with 3 default users
   - Do not delete default admin unless you have another
   - Default passwords should be changed in production

4. **Email is Optional**
   - Email field is not required
   - If provided, must be unique
   - Can be used for future features (password reset, notifications)

5. **Soft Delete**
   - Delete button deactivates, not removes
   - Data preserved for audit trails
   - Can be reactivated anytime
